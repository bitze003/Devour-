# DevourIT-

<p>This app creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js and an ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.</p>

Overview:
<br>This app allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
<br>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app places the burger in the "Available" section.
<br>Each burger in the waiting section has a DEVOUR button.
<br>When the user clicks it, the burger has been devoured and moves to the "Devoured" section.
<br>The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
